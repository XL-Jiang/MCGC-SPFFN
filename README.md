# MCGC-SPFFN
Code for Self-Perceptive Feature Fusion Network with Multi-Channel Graph Convolution for Brain Disorder Diagnosis.

(1) The edges were adaptively constructed by the adaptive edge learning network (AELN), which captures the subtle discrepancies of graphs.
(2) A self-perceptive feature fusion (SPFF) module, which includes an accuracy-weighted voting strategy for fusing features within the same channel, and a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for fusing multi-scale features. 
(3) The channel diversity and scale correlation constraints were implemented to thoroughly investigate the latent relationships among features.
